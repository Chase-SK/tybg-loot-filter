# tybg-loot-filter
Loot filter config file for OSRS

This is an attempt at maintaining a central config file to eventually build a comprehensive loot filter for the TYBG clan to use.
This config file is to be used in part with the loot-filter plugin https://github.com/riktenx/loot-filters/blob/main/README.md
